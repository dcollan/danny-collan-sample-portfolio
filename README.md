## User Story
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Objective
Writing from scratch, create a mockup HTML page with CSS styling that represents a portfolio consisting of an 'About Me' section, a 'Work' section,
and a 'Contact Me' section. In the 'Work' section, it should consist
of projects with descriptive titles that will navigate to a different page upon click, as well as an interactive layout upon hover. There should be a
navbar that will scroll over to a specific section upon click of an element,
as well as a 'Contact Me' section that contains links to your email, your
phone, and your Github.
